# PlutusCoreEnhanced

Plutus Core Enhanced is a customizable, exchange agnostic cryptocurrency trading bot. You configure:

* Which cryptocurrencies to buy & sell
* Profit amount & loss tolerance
* Which cryptocurrency exchanges you want to buy & sell from **[As of now Binance API integration is completed]**
* Integrated Technical Analysis libraries
* Added below strategies [Use for your reference only - Create custom based on your need]:
Aroon crossovers, SMA, EMA, DEMA, TEMA, HeikinAshi and CandleStick

It does the rest by predicting if the price is going up or down for a given coin and buying and selling according to your profit and loss stops.
* Auto buying function is off for security purpose - **though system is calculating order cost and alert you if not enough balance in your account**

Plutus is currently just a prototype. All contributions are welcome.
